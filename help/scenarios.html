        <div>Some of the simplest websites are those that are for companies that don't operate online businesses, but that still want to have an online presence to provide information for prospective customers, and to entice them to contact the company for more information or to schedule a meeting.</div>
        <br>
        <div>Agency websites are a good example of these. While a good site will have lots of content like blogs, awards, clients, and more, the site doesn't have to have much information beyond the company's core capabilities and a form to fill out for people to request more information.</div>
        <br>
        <div>This example site is exactly that. It has just two pages. The first page provides information about the capabilities, and the second page is a form for users to submit their contact information so that they can be provided with more information.</div>
        <br>
        <div><strong>The main goal for this client is lead submissions.</strong> This is completed through the "Learn More" form that you can navigate to from the menu of the main scenario page, or at the bottom of each of the capabilities sections.</div>

          <h2>Scenario 2</h2>
          <h3>The Daily News Times</h3>
          <img src="/img/scenario2.jpg" alt="" width="80%">
        </a>
        <div>Content publishers are some of the most important companies on the internet, ranging from the most trusted news sources in the world to the most procrastination-inducing listicle sites and everything in between. They make all of the content that keeps people coming back.</div>
        <br>
        <div>The primary business model for these sites is to produce great content that does two things... 1) motivate people to visit more pages so that the publisher can show them more display ads (making money each time an "impression" is served.), and 2) convince people to subscribe to the site to unlock more content.</div>
        <br>
        <div>This example content site has three categories of content, News, Food, and Sports, and many articles, but only the five most recent articles are available without subscribing.</div>
        <br>
        <div><strong>The main goal for this client is to get users to sign up for a subscription to unlock the rest of the articles.</strong> Users can take this action by navigating to the Subscribe Now page from the menu at the top of the page, from the end of any article, or from the "paywall" that pops up once you've read five articles.</div>

          <h2>Scenario 3</h2>
          <h3>Shirts Mugs & Beyond</h3>
          <img src="/img/scenario3.jpg" alt="" width="80%">
        </a>
        <div>As the internet has grown, nearly every company has made their products available to buy online... we call this "eCommerce". These are some of the most common sites on the internet, and can range from massive wholesalers selling everything from A to Z, to mom and pop stores that want in on the interwebs.</div>
        <br>
        <div>These sites are pretty straight-forward. They generally have at least one category page that highlights the groups of products they sell, individual product pages, a shopping cart that lets users store the products they want, and a checkout flow for users to complete purchases.</div>
        <br>
        <div>This example site has just one category page with three products. You can click to add products to your cart, but this site isn't actually connected to a database, so instead of storing what you add, when you get to your cart, you'll see the same products added each time. From the cart, you can complete your purchase and get to the confirmation page.</div>
        <br>
        <div><strong>The main goal for this client is revenue.</strong> Because all of their products have different prices, they don't care if they sell one product for $1 million or 1 million products for $1 each, so it is most important that we track how much revenue we are generating with each purchase.</div>
